      { question: "Who developed the C language and when?", answer: "Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in 1972." },

      { question: "What is the very first thing a C compiler looks for?", answer: "The main() function. Execution starts here!" },
      { question: "Is C a Case-Sensitive language?", answer: "Yes! 'Variable' and 'variable' are treated as two different things." },
      { question: "What does the '\\n' character do in a printf statement?", answer: "It creates a 'New Line', moving the cursor to the next line." },
      { question: "How do you declare a constant value that can't be changed?", answer: "By using the 'const' keyword (e.g., const int speed = 100;)." },
      { question: "What is the purpose of the semi-colon (;) in C?", answer: "It acts as a 'Statement Terminator' to show where a command ends." },
      { question: "Which header file is needed for printf() and scanf()?", answer: "stdio.h (Standard Input Output)." },
      { question: "What are the 3 basic types of variables in C?", answer: "int (integers), float (decimals), and char (single characters)." },

  { q: "Which data type would you use to store a student's grade (e.g., 'A')?", options: ["int", "float", "char", "double"], correct: 2, explanation: "The 'char' data type is designed specifically to store single characters or ASCII symbols." },
  { q: "What happens if you store 5.9 in an 'int' variable?", options: ["It rounds to 6", "It stays 5.9", "It truncates to 5", "It causes an error"], correct: 2, explanation: "Integers do not support decimals; C truncates the fractional part, keeping only the whole number." },
  { q: "Which of these variable names follows C naming conventions?", options: ["2nd_year", "student name", "_score", "total-amt"], correct: 2, explanation: "Variables must start with a letter or underscore and cannot contain spaces or hyphens." },
  { q: "Why is 'double' preferred over 'float' for scientific calculations?", options: ["It is faster", "It uses less memory", "It has higher precision", "It is easier to type"], correct: 2, explanation: "Double-precision variables provide roughly 15-17 decimal digits of precision, compared to 6-7 for float." },
  { q: "What is the purpose of 'type casting' in C?", options: ["To delete a variable", "To change a variable's data type temporarily", "To rename a variable", "To hide code from the compiler"], correct: 1, explanation: "Type casting allows you to force a variable of one type to act as another for a specific operation." },
  { q: "Which keyword is used to define a variable whose value never changes?", options: ["static", "fixed", "const", "permanent"], correct: 2, explanation: "The 'const' keyword creates a read-only variable that cannot be modified after initialization." },
  { q: "What does the 'sizeof' operator actually return?", options: ["The number of bits", "The number of bytes", "The variable name length", "The value stored"], correct: 1, explanation: "Sizeof calculates the memory footprint of a data type or variable in bytes." },
  { q: "Which format specifier is required to print a 'double' value?", options: ["%d", "%f", "%c", "%lf"], correct: 3, explanation: "While %f works for floats, %lf (Long Float) is the precise specifier for double values." },
  { q: "In C, a 'char' variable is actually stored internally as:", options: ["A small image", "A string", "An ASCII integer value", "A boolean"], correct: 2, explanation: "Characters are mapped to specific integer values in the ASCII table for machine processing." },
  { q: "What is the result of 'signed' vs 'unsigned' for an integer?", options: ["Signed allows negative numbers", "Unsigned is faster", "Signed uses more memory", "There is no difference"], correct: 0, explanation: "Signed integers reserve one bit for the +/- sign, whereas unsigned use all bits for positive range." }

    options: ["positive", "unsigned", "signed", "long"],
    correct: 1,
